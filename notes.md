# Detecting the chip.

## ESP8266
Some ESP8266 apparently boot with the serial port not set to 115200 baud. See
[https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp8266/advanced-topics/serial-protocol.html#initial-synchronisation](here)
for details.

Therefore we cannot try to find the text "waiting for download\r\n" and must
just wait for the serial port read to time out.

The ESP8266's ROM loader has a two byte status in each response packet. In
contrast, the other chips' ROM loaders use 4 bytes.

My ESP8266's magic number is 0xFFF0C101.

## ESP32

My ESP32's magic number is 0x00F01D83.

## ESP32-S2

My ESP32-S2's magic number is 0x000007C6.

## ESP32-S3

My ESP32-S3's magic number is 0x00000009.

The ESP32-S3 technical reference manual doesn't list SPI register addresses,
but they do share a base address with the ESP32-C3 and using the same regs
seem to work to read the flash id.

## ESP32-C3

My ESP32-C3's magic number is 0x1B31506F.


# Changing the baud rate

## ESP32-C3

Setting the baud rate to something smaller than 115200 causes timeouts. I
should attach my logic analyzer to debug.
